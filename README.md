# Flappy Bird brute-force-machine-learning

Coded a knock-off flappy bird game

Used a brute-force method of making each generation of flappy birds perform better at the game and obtain highscores with each subsequent generation based on timing of jumps, velocity of fall at current time, and distance of pipes
